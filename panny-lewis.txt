    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one.  Use class to apply multiple styles.  Example, all div with class = content are styled in blue color.  Use Id to make a single reference.  Example, an anchor that points to the id = About Us, will jump either up or down the page to wherever you placed the id.  That's why there can only one instance of that id otherwise the browser would jumping all over.

    34. Why should I use version control? Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time
    35. How often should I commit to github? Every time I make a change.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? git push origin (name)

        Git status (check for new added changes), git add . (adds the changes), git commit -m " " (add notes and comment about the changes), git push origin "name of the branch"

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).  An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?  
        The element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent, absolute is relative to its parent.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        Use flexbox.  display: flex;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        blocks:  <address>, <header>, <footer>;
        inlines:  <a>, <p>, <li>
        both: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        It's just like a cell.  It has a margin (membrane), border(membrane), padding(cytoplasm), and core(nucleus).
